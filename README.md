Asuoki Messenger is a privacy-focused messenger powered by blockchain technology. For communication, a blockchain is created, consisting of 2 users. The guarantee that someone else (an attacker) will use this blockchain is the Proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus, which provides access to the blockchain only to certain wallets (users). RSA asymmetric encryption is also used to ensure security. Communication takes place using a locally-created site, to which only you and only from your PC have access. All this ensures the security of your personal data and ensures that it will be viewed only by the person to whom it was sent.
